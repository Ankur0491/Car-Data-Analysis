# Car Features Analysis Project

## Introduction
The owner of a car showroom handles a variety of car types and models. This dataset includes a range of features for each car, corresponding to the models present in the showroom. The price of each car is determined by its unique attributes. Our objective is to examine these various car features and understand how they influence the car's pricing.

## Objectives
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the given dataset.
2. Summarize the data using descriptive statistics.
3. Identify the costliest car and the cheapest car by average price.
4. Determine which fuel type car has the highest average price.
5. Construct a contingency table using “make” as the row variable.
6. Calculate probabilities for various car makes.
7. Perform hypothesis testing on car prices based on fuel types.
8. Calculate probabilities for selecting luxury cars and specific car arrangements.
9. Analyze the relationship between car features and their pricing.
